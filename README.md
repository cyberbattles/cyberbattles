<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
CyberBattles is our attempt to create an educational platform to help people gain experience in real world cybersecurity attacks.

Currently there are no educational platforms to help students and aspiring cyber professional practice active attack and defense of cyber security attacks. Our team has created an open source platform that allows users to host and participate in challenges without having to join formally held competitions. This will greatly help University clubs and educational groups with teaching a more active style of cyber security.

Users can create games using our existing challenge or submit their own challenges to our code repository to be added to the platform. From there each teams face off receiving identical virtual machines where they try to attack other teams and defend against them. They do this using either our online interface or a remote connection from their own computer to try and patch vulnerabilities, view other teams services and execute attacks. 

Most platforms operate in one direction, with teams practicing their skills by attacking static machines. CyberBattles provides a unique value proposition for aspiring cyber security professionals and those looking to learn.

## About The Team
CyberBattles is the capstone project for this team, completed as part of a software engineering class to test our abilities and provide experience working as a team. As final year CompSci students we sought to show off the best of what we could do.
